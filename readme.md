## Coquito Typescript Template

#### Scripts

- `npm run build` compile typescript to build folder
- `npm run start` run built files
- `npm run ts-dev` build typescript in watch mode
- `npm run dev` run built files in watch mode

To get auto updates run ts-dev in one terminal then dev in another. A change in your ts code will trigger the ts rebuild, which will trigger the JS watch.
